# API created in .NET Core that uploads images to Firebase Storage 🤩

## Steps to follow:
* 👉 Create your project in Firebase
* 👉 Register your web project in Firebase
* 👉 You must Enable Firebase Storage and Firebase Authentication.
* 👉 You must enable the login with Mail / Password in Firebase Auth and create a user.
* 👉 In the FirebaseStorageManager class you must replace the api key, the name of your bucket and the user you created.

# Important points ✌️
* You get the api key of your project in Firebase by clicking on the settings icon and then on project settings and copy your Web API key.
* You can find the name of the bucket by clicking on Storage in the main menu and copy the link "nameyourproject.appspot.com".
* Finally put the user and password that you created in Firebase Auth.
* Take note that the image must be in base64 format. You can convert an image to base64 here 👉 https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image
